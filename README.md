# Extended-And-Standard-ACL-With-Cisco-Packet-Tracer

This repository contains simulation files and a final report for networking and Linux configuration tasks done as part of an academic assignment.

## 🔧 Contents

- `ACL 2.pkt` - Cisco Packet Tracer file demonstrating **Standard ACL (Access Control List)** configuration.
- `extended ACL.pkt` - Cisco Packet Tracer file showing **Extended ACL** setup for granular control of traffic.
- `linux final reportpdf.docx` and `.pdf` - Final report on Linux topics including:
  - Standard vs. Extended ACLs
  - File permissions
  - Linux administration concepts

## 🧪 Tools Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer** (for ACL simulation)
- **Linux (Red Hat-based environment)** for system-level configurations
- **Microsoft Word** for documentation

## 🎯 Objective

To understand and implement:
- Network traffic control using ACLs
- Basic to advanced Linux administration commands and configurations
- Secure and effective network policy enforcement

## 📁 How to Use

1. Download the `.pkt` files and open them in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
2. Refer to the configuration inside the devices for ACL commands.
3. Open the report for step-by-step explanation and analysis.
